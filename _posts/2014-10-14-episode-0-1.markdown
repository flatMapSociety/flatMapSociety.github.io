This is the alpha, limited release, pilot, other qualifier episode of The flatMap Society.  It's more than an episode 0, but definitely not yet an episode 1.0.  Like the website so far it's pretty rough.

In this episode [Andrew][andrew] and [Steven][steven] talk about their experience with a recently completed project: a [Typesafe Activator template][activator].

**Update** The itunes link is now working!
